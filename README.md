# Python Fidget Spinner
Basic python fidget spinner, coded Feb 2022

**What I enjoyed while writing this program:** I had only done written Python programs from the Codecademy curriculum, so this was my first attempt at following a tutorial online, so I'm pretty proud of that. I also really like working with the turtle graphics library.

**What I struggled with while building this app:** Keeping the rotation animation straight in my head! I don't know why, but it was really difficult to wrap my head around that at first. 

**Things I learned through building this app:** Python is super flexible! It was really cool to see something that I could interact with.
